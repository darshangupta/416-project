    <h1 class="title">Car Information Visualization</h1>
    <div class="narrative">
      <p>Welcome to the narrative visualization of how certain factors affect vehicle performance. In this visualization, we will analyze data from a dataset containing various attributes of cars, including fuel efficiency, horsepower, and more. We'll focus on three key visualizations to uncover meaningful insights about the relationship between these factors.</p>
      <p>Let's dive into each visualization to gain a deeper understanding of how fuel efficiency, horsepower, and other factors impact car prices and performance.</p>

    <div class="graph-descriptions">
      <div class="scene" id="scatterPlot">
        <h2 class="chart-title">Scatter Plot: Drive Wheel vs. Horsepower</h2>
        <div class="chart-description">
          <p>This scatter plot demonstrates the relationship between drive wheel and horsepower of cars. Each point represents a car, and its position on the plot is determined by its drive wheel (x-axis) and horsepower (y-axis).</p>
          <p>Takeaways: We can observe how drive wheel and horsepower are correlated. Generally, rwd cars have the highest horsepower and fwd have the lowest.</p>

      <div class="scene" id="barChart">
        <h2 class="chart-title">Bar Chart: Average Price by Engine Location</h2>
        <div class="chart-description">
          <p>This bar chart presents the average price of cars (y-axis) categorized by their engine location (on x-axis, either front or rear).</p>
          <p>Takeaways: By analyzing the bar chart, we can identify that rear engine cars are generally more expensive than front engine cars.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="scene" id="bubbleChart">
        <h2 class="chart-title">Bubble Chart: Price vs. Horsepower vs. Curbweight</h2>
        <div class="chart-description">
          <p>This bubble chart illustrates the relationship between curbweight (represented by the size of bubbles), Horsepower (x-axis), and Price (y-axis). The blue bubbles are front engine cars, and the orange bubbles are rear engine cars.</p>
          <p>Takeaways: By examining the bubble chart, we can conclude that higher horsepower cars are generally more expensive. And, although a looser correlation, heavier cars are generally more expensive as well.</p>
